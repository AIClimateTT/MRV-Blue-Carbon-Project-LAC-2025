**Processing was conducted in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to prepare surface reflectance imagery (Level-2A) from July 2015, representative of the LiDAR acquisition period.**
  
Steps:
1) Image Selection   
Platform: Sentinel-2 Level-2A surface reflectance.   
Area: Caroni mangrove testbed, Trinidad (bounding box provided).   
Time range: July 2015.  
Filtered for <20% cloud cover.

2) Cloud Masking  
Applied SCL (Scene Classification Layer) to remove clouds and shadows.  
Remaining cloudy pixels masked out (set to nodata = -9999).  

3) Image Composition  
Created a median composite (optionally switchable to mosaic) to ensure uniform coverage.  
Resampled imagery to 20 m resolution to align with LiDAR and DEM datasets.  

4) Spectral Index Calculation  
Calculated:  
NDVI = (B8 – B4) / (B8 + B4)  
EVI = 2.5 × (B8 – B4) / (B8 + 6×B4 – 7.5×B2 + 1)  

Added NDVI and EVI bands to image stack.

5) Export  
CSV: Exported pixel-level values (x, y coordinates, reflectance bands, NDVI, EVI).  
Raster: Exported GeoTIFF for visualization and cross-validation with LiDAR.    
Masked cloud pixels (-9999) excluded.
